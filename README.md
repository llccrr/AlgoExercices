TODO: Remove BotProgramming from Repo, create a repo for it.

## HS.ia: time spent: 15 hours
An algorithms working phase by phase 
1 - Summon
2 - Attack

When trying to add spell, it interfer with both phase, which make it difficult, it's not appropriate
Need to refacto the entire code so that one turn include simulations of Summon + Spell + attack as a single phase using MCTS
